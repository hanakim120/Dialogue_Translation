16
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,626
Dear Yeon-jin, whom I miss.

17
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,919
TO YEON-JIN

18
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,254
Do you remember

19
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,717
that I used to hate the summer?

20
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,763
Thankfully, I moved away
before it got even hotter.

21
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,267
I've been organizing my pictures
since yesterday,

22
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,437
but it's taking a while
because they're all such lovely faces.

23
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,980
WEATHERCASTER PARK YEON-JIN

24
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,898
I started picturing in my head

25
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,859
that someday

26
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,322
you might open that front door
and walk in here.

27
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,748
What is all this?

28
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,084
That's Jae-jun and Sa-ra.
These are all pictures of us.

29
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,420
Hey,

30
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,256
who are you anyway?

31
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,636
It's me, Yeon-jin. It's me.

32
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,849
You really haven't changed at all.

33
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,894
You're still so rude.

34
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,397
You should take your shoes off
when entering someone else's home.

35
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,949
You've given me
yet another reason to kill you.

36
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,910
You should have at least recognized me.

37
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,455
Kill me?

38
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,873
You think you can kill me?

39
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,208
Yeah, I will.

40
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,461
I'm going to try my hardest to kill you.

41
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,130
So come quickly, Yeon-jin.

42
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,174
I'm already here.

43
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,718
Oh!

44
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,221
Do you want to hear about

45
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,057
how I came to be where I am now

46
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,227
while you're on your way here?

47
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,772
CHIEF SHIN YEONG-JUN

48
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,315
An official report was filed,

49
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,692
so the guardians have to come
and follow the procedure.

50
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,987
I'll let her off easy, so don't worry.

51
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,031
Yeah. I'll call you.

52
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,241
SUMMER OF 2004

53
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,410
Park Yeon-jin.

54
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,580
-Yeah?
-Why would you bully a friend?

55
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,416
Don't come back for something like this.

56
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,251
Your mother's nearly here, so go.

57
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,502
She's not my friend.

58
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,753
By the way, Mister.

59
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,423
What's going on between you and my mom?

60
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,384
We're friends from middle school.

61
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,803
Oh, so you're like Son Myeong-o to my mom?

62
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,389
That's why you helped her
with her divorce.

63
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,183
And gathered all the evidence
of my dad having an affair.

64
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,395
I thought you slept
with my mom or something.

65
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,110
Let's go now!

66
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,821
The deliveries are backed up.
Get up and go!

67
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,157
You're so embarrassing.
I told you not to come!

68
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,326
It's all good if they make up
and give each other a hug.

69
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,661
Sa-ra, come on.

70
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,965
How can I help you?

71
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,676
I'm Dong-eun's guardian,
her homeroom teacher.

72
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,142
Hey. You came here
with your fucking uniform on?!

73
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,061
And you called the police
over a little prank between friends?

74
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,688
The vice principal got the call--

75
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,568
I'll deal with you later.
Get up, and let's go!

76
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,153
Sir, take me too.

77
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,905
I'm an orphan for a week.

78
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,407
My parents are abroad.

79
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,910
-Golfing.
-Oh yeah?

80
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,996
Then you should have called me.

81
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,748
I'll take him too.

82
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,999
Oh, sure.

83
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,669
Hey, I was wondering
why you are still here.

84
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,421
So, what about your meals?

85
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
-I have a housekeeper.
-Oh, do you?

86
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,640
I told you today was important.

87
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,726
You've disappointed me so much today.

88
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,063
I didn't know I'd end up with the cops.

89
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,232
That's why I'm disappointed.

90
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,567
You couldn't handle a girl
who has nothing.

91
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,698
And didn't I tell you
to only hang out with Jae-jun?

92
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,908
And Sa-ra, if you're bored.

93
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,702
The shaman told you

94
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,040
to avoid people with O's in their names
because they'd bring you bad luck.

95
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,876
I'm talking about
Son Myeong-o and Choi Hye-jeong!

96
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,963
Come inside. We're late.

97
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,139
MOON DONG-EUN

98
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,982
Here comes Dong-eun!

99
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,402
It's the same Dong-eun
you get to see every day!

100
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,657
Welcome, Dong-eun.

101
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,622
I'm sorry for bullying you
for all this time.

102
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,248
I wanted to apologize.

103
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,042
You won't be mad anymore, right?

104
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,172
There was no need to call the cops
about it. You scared us.

105
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,468
Speaking of which, Dong-eun,

106
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,804
can you check, from now on,

107
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,140
if the curling iron is hot enough?

108
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,480
Let go! Let me go!

109
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,732
This is a crime! Let me go!

110
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,235
Hey, it's just a small favor.
How is that a crime?

111
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,154
She said she's sorry.

112
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,239
I just want you to check
if it's hot or not.

113
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,246
Is it that hot?

114
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,250
I think it's ready.

115
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:09,960
Let's see.

116
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:16,467
Somebody help! Please, somebody help me!

117
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,261
Hey, don't waste your energy!

118
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,056
You can scream all you want,
but nobody will find out.

119
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,391
Nobody's coming for you.

120
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,395
The gym teacher gave us the key!

121
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,821
Why are you doing this to me?

122
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,199
Why are you doing this to me?

123
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,493
I'm so sick of hearing that.

124
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,913
Why do you guys always ask that?

125
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,290
'Cause even if I do this,
nothing will happen to me,

126
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,751
and nothing will change for you.

127
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,420
Look at you now.

128
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,631
You caused a fucking scene at the station,
but you're right back here.

129
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,675
Has anything changed?

130
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,971
What I'm saying is,
nobody will protect you, Dong-eun.

131
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,474
Not the police, not the school,
and not even your parents.

132
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,977
What do you call a person like that?

133
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,521
An underdog.

134
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,526
You live at an inn, right?

135
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,320
I learned about motel living
thanks to you.

136
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,656
Her rent is due
every full moon, apparently.

137
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,743
That sounds like a total fairy tale!

138
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,246
Wow, Dong-eun must be my fairy godmother.

139
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,999
She even checks the heat
so I can do my hair, right?

140
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,544
Let go!

141
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,337
Let me go!

142
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,506
-Let me go!
-Shut up!

143
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,800
-Let go.
-Myeong-o, shut her up.

144
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,718
Let go!

145
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,889
You're being too loud in a public place.

146
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,247
Hydrogen peroxide solution?

147
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,292
If you give it to me, I'll do it.

148
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,795
There's something on my shirt.

149
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,129
What's on your shirt?

150
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,633
Is it blood?

151
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,096
Please just give me the hydrogen peroxide.

152
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,395
What happened? Who did this?

153
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,856
Did you tell your homeroom teacher?

154
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,068
I've seen a scar like this before.

155
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,905
If it's too hard for you alone,
I'll go with you when you tell him.

156
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,824
Who was it?

157
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,464
Yeah, Mom.

158
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,300
I'll call you back.

159
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,055
It was me.

160
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,642
It was me last time too.

161
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,445
Do you know, Yeon-jin…

162
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,870
that your daughter likes
to look at the world upside down?

163
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,374
Is it because when the world
is upside down,

164
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,211
people will understand you even if
you can't tell some colors apart?

165
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,846
Your shoes look just like my mom's.

166
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,063
So it's you.

167
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,275
Park Yeon-jin's daughter, Ha Ye-sol.

168
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,444
Do you know my mom?

169
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,906
I think about her every day.

170
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,493
Some hatred resembles longing.

171
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,121
It's impossible to get rid of.

172
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,289
"Hatred"?

173
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,459
I don't know that word. What does it mean?

174
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,300
What does hatred mean?

175
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,335
That's so freaking funny!

176
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,388
Huh? What?

177
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,598
Are you gonna run?

178
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,161
Her eyes that turned darker
when she got excited.

179
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,414
What took you so long?

180
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,417
I missed you so much.

181
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,502
Her lips that curled up when she smiled.

182
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,380
Every single strand of her beautiful hair.

183
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,924
Put all of that together,

184
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,343
and that's what hatred is.

185
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,851
She took her shoes off before coming in!

186
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,603
We're real pieces of shit. Shame on us.

187
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,147
Hey, move.

188
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,442
Is this yours?

189
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,777
I found this in the rice container.

190
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,864
-I couldn't believe my own eyes.
-Give that back--

191
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,950
Oh no.

192
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,369
Is Dong-eun mad?

193
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,580
Nice catch.

194
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,999
It's quite a lot!

195
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,294
Really? That's freaking sad.

196
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,462
Dong-eun.

197
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,965
You're so frugal!

198
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,509
Crazy bitch.
What the fuck did you take this time?

199
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,053
Cold syrup or glue?

200
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,307
Stop! Stop doing that!

201
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,685
Dong-eun is so freaking rich!

202
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,313
-It's about 200,000 won.
-Are you paying for all this?

203
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,233
You guys are rich!
You don't need that money!

204
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,946
I'm begging you.
Please give it back, Yeon-jin.

205
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,533
I see you're behaving politely now.

206
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,160
Fine.

207
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,829
I'll give it back.

208
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,167
But I want you to dance
while we're drinking.

209
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,836
Then I won't touch this money. How's that?

210
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,380
-What?
-I said, dance!

211
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,176
Singing and dancing go well
with drinking, you know.

212
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,262
What? You don't want to?

213
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,184
If you really don't want to,
there is another way.

214
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,312
I found this at your place.

215
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,192
You're such a mess right now.

216
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,277
But if you try to act all proud,

217
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,949
then you will become an even bigger mess.

218
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,493
So dance.

219
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,745
In humiliation.

220
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,875
If you don't want to, fine.

221
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:53,048
But seeing you today, Dong-eun…

222
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,719
even your legs are pretty.

223
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,981
I'll choose the song.

224
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,817
I have so many freaking ringtones.

225
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,593
NURSE'S OFFICE

226
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,268
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
DUE TO RESIGNATION OF THE SCHOOL NURSE

227
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,182
Really? When?

228
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,518
I'll call you later.

229
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,690
Hey, Dong-eun dropped out of school.

230
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,276
But she wrote all of our names
on the withdrawal form.

231
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,739
She gave it to the vice principal,
who is nagging at our teacher right now.

232
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,950
Was it the gym teacher?

233
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,828
In the order of who hit her the most?
Or alphabetical order?

234
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,582
I wonder where my name is on the list.

235
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,709
Can't you read the room?

236
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,798
Hey!

237
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,549
Jae-jun! Yeon-jin!

238
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,967
Come here.

239
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,768
You crazy bitch!

240
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,771
If you want to drop out,
do it without a fuss.

241
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,524
Did you do nothing wrong?
Not a single thing?

242
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,777
If it's come to this,
there's something wrong with you too!

243
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,737
Come redo your withdrawal form now!

244
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,081
SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL LETTER

245
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,999
If this goes to the principal,

246
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,752
it will affect
your work evaluation, Mr. Kim.

247
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,755
I know that, okay? So please.

248
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,515
What is this?

249
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,102
What kind of reason is this?

250
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,438
School violence.

251
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,066
Yeon-jin, Sa-ra, Jae-jun, Hye-jeong,
and Myeong-o are the perps.

252
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,696
And you are a bystander.

253
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,197
Shut that mouth of yours!

254
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,700
Did they break your arm or your leg?

255
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,952
You're walking around
with all your limbs intact.

256
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,620
How is it violence?

257
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,664
How am I a bystander?

258
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,916
You're insane at this point,
you know that?

259
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,669
It's okay for friends
to give each other a slap!

260
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,753
And why

261
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,923
is it okay to slap a friend?

262
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,593
What?

263
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,596
You bragged that your son got
into a university of education, right?

264
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,185
So, is it okay if your son gets slapped
by his friends too--

265
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,232
I've been treating you nicely.

266
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,152
And now you're asking for it.

267
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,196
Wow.

268
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,907
What did you

269
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,743
say about

270
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,120
my son?

271
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,789
Say that again. What did you say?

272
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,124
-Get up!
-Don't do this.

273
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,042
Hey.

274
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,003
-Move. What did you say?
-Mr. Kim!

275
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,838
-Get up! What did you say?
-Kim!

276
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,381
Stop it, now.

277
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,675
Move. Hey!

278
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,260
-Mr. Kim!
-Get out of the way!

279
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,637
-Stop!
-Hey!

280
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,013
-Enough!
-Get up!

281
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,099
NEW WORLD BARBERSHOP

282
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,854
Ms. Jeong, your phone's ringing.

283
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,689
Coming!

284
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,692
-Oh, come on!
-What's wrong?

285
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,903
Just give me a second.

286
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,030
Gosh!

287
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,536
Yes, hello?

288
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,705
Yeah.

289
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,459
I'm her mother.

290
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,254
Who is this?

291
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,518
Go ahead and open it. It's all right.

292
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,898
Oh my!

293
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,817
ONE MILLION WON

294
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,363
And I need the father's signature here.

295
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,949
Oh, I'm not technically Dong-eun's father.

296
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,534
But I'm like a father to her.

297
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,452
Then,

298
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,288
you sign it.

299
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,415
-Oh.
-Yes.

300
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,541
SETTLEMENT LETTER

301
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:28,128
Sometimes,
legal matters are important, you know.

302
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,840
I don't have a signature.

303
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,175
Can I just write my name down?

304
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,343
Sure.

305
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,889
You can write your name there,
and rewrite the reason for us.

306
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,933
-Reason?
-It's really short.

307
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,893
"Maladjustment."

308
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,399
ROOM FOR RENT

309
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,870
Did you forget something?

310
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,457
Hey, you didn't know?

311
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,543
Your mom cleared the room out
this morning.

312
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,505
My goodness. This is your school uniform.

313
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,967
I'm sure she will call you.

314
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,719
She's your mom, after all.

315
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,222
Goodness.

316
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,019
SPACE GROUP OF KOREA
ARCHITECTURE AND SOCIETY

317
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,830
REASON FOR WITHDRAWAL: MALADJUSTMENT

318
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,750
GUARDIAN: JEONG MI-HEE

319
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,961
GIMBAP HEAVEN

320
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,826
My scars were itching,

321
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,163
and my stomach was in excruciating pain
from period cramps.

322
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,499
At that moment, I had this thought.

323
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,961
"The pharmacy doesn't open until 9 a.m.,

324
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,047
and the Han River
is just a 20-minute walk away."

325
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,092
"The water will be cold,

326
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,262
and then everything will be okay."

327
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,723
"The scars won't itch anymore."

328
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,517
"What more could I want?"

329
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,771
"This is probably the right thing."

330
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,417
Does Dong-eun

331
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,670
have a pretty face?

332
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,129
From the guys' point of view.

333
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,091
I don't know.

334
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,968
Don't try to act dumb.

335
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,222
Maybe it's not just her face
that's pretty.

336
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,476
Then why didn't you just cover her mouth?
Move. You're heavy.

337
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,022
Where are you going? To get more drinks?

338
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,941
Tell Hye-jeong to go.

339
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,569
I would if it were for drinks.

340
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,404
It's the morning prayer service.

341
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,658
Damn. The geezer will get rid of my studio
if I don't come right away. Fuck!

342
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,912
It's a special service for seniors.
I had to stop him from calling you guys.

343
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,874
Hey. Do you want him to stop calling you?

344
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,126
How many white shirts do you have?

345
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,627
-Amen!
-Amen!

346
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,964
Jesus Christ said,

347
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:29,804
"If anyone slaps you on the right cheek,
turn to them the other cheek also."

348
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,805
-Amen!
-Amen!

349
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,767
"And if anyone wants to take your shirt,
hand over your coat as well."

350
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,227
-Amen!
-Amen!

351
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:40,648
"If anyone forces you to go one mile,
go with them two miles--"

352
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,150
-Amen!
-Amen!

353
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,611
-We believe in you, Lord.
-Amen.

354
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,739
Sa-ra's dad's voice cracking
was hilarious.

355
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,657
You should have seen his face!

356
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,993
Maybe he was shocked
that there's nothing to see?

357
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,495
Hey!

358
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,873
-I want chocolate milk.
-Huh?

359
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,710
Okay.

360
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,255
-What about you guys?
-Hye-jeong!

361
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,300
I told you, I'm fasting this week!

362
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,676
Ugh, damn it.

363
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,347
Hey, Gyeong-ran.

364
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,599
How long you gonna cry for? All night?

365
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,018
Stop weeping, you fucking bitch.

366
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,854
Fuck, you're so loud. Damn it.

367
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,567
Gyeong-ran.

368
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,403
Scream again,
and I'll shove this in your mouth.

369
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,245
What is she doing here?

370
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,143
She must be nuts. She came here by choice?

371
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,567
Wow, Dong-eun.

372
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,154
I missed you so much.

373
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,740
You dropped out without even a word.

374
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,995
Your dream that you wrote
on your Cyworld page.

375
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,998
"A wise mother and a kind wife."
Did you mean it?

376
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,167
Really? Did you really write that?

377
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,715
Where the hell is this coming from?

378
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,883
Sa-ra wants to paint.

379
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,512
Jae-jun will inherit a golf course.
Hye-jeong, a flight attendant.

380
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,640
Is your dream
to be a wise mother and a kind wife?

381
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,476
What the fuck?

382
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,353
Why did you leave me out?

383
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,023
I have a dream too.
I'm going to be a millionaire.

384
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,859
I don't have a dream, Dong-eun.

385
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,361
Dreams are for people like you.

386
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,282
You, him, and her.

387
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,368
I pay you to work for me,
after your dreams come true.

388
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,581
I don't need a dream. I need a job.

389
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,833
A job that's not too shabby, you know?

390
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,046
Then I'll probably get married
when I'm young and pretty.

391
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,799
Pick out an eligible bachelor,
and have one or two kids.

392
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,719
Then I'll live happily ever after.

393
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:18,639
There isn't a word
that summarizes all of that, right?

394
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,224
Yeah, there is.

395
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,893
"Bullshit."

396
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,311
Shut the fuck up, Sa-ra.

397
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,480
So scary!

398
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,817
So?

399
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,737
What's your dream?

400
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,324
You.

401
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,578
Starting today, my dream is you.

402
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,122
I really hope…

403
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,125
we'll see each other again.

404
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,732
SUMMER OF 2006

405
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,265
Quit the monkey business. Put it away!

406
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,517
Hey, don't be too hard on her!

407
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,520
She has so many cigarette burn scars
on her arms and legs.

408
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,148
Do your job.

409
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,210
GED EXAM RESULTS

410
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,427

FALL OF 2008

416
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,536
Excuse me.

417
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,419
I'm not trying to distract you.

418
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,216
I'm 20 years old,
and my name is Koo Seong-hee.

419
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,387
I heard you're leaving the factory
at the end of this month.

420
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:31,684
So I just wanted to strike up
a conversation with you before you quit.

421
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,730
Same here. Thank you.

422
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,732
For what?

423
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,859
Walking on your tiptoes.

424
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,320
You saw that?

425
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,822
Anyway, congratulations!

426
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,408
I heard that you got into college.

427
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,161
Wow, you must be so happy.

428
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,414
You can go on group dates
and get a boyfriend in college!

429
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,336
That's not really what I'm looking for.

430
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,628
I'm going to college

431
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,922
'cause there's somewhere
I really need to go.

432
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,342
Where do you need to go?

433
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,094
Samsung?

434
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,637
Hyundai?

435
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,396
I wasn't joking, Yeon-jin.

436
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,567
Ever since that day,
my only dream has always been you.

437
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,988
SUNGWU TEXTILE

438
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,656
SPRING OF 2009

439
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,534
I'll have the strongest coffee
that you have, please. Cold.

440
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,452
I'm quite sleepy.

441
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,038
Would you like an iced Americano
with an extra shot?

442
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,624
Sure. I'll have that.

443
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,003
It will be served at the pickup area.

444
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,755
Next customer, please.

445
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,094
One iced Americano
and one warm mocha latte, please.

446
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,222
I want a ton of whipped cream
and chocolate drizzle on the latte.

447
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,725
We'll be paying separately,
but please put both stamps on my coupon.

448
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,019
I knew you'd say that,
so I didn't bring my wallet.

449
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,480
-Dammit.
-Drinks will be served at the pickup area.

450
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,149
Next customer, please.

451
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,860
Gather a mountain to make some dust,
you know.

452
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:05,861
Yeo-jeong.

453
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,948
-Gather coupons to make you rich.
-How does that happen?

454
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,074
Help a little brother.

455
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,411
You always say that and make me pay.
Please act like my senior.

456
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,328
Okay.

457
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,706
At least you can get rich
with the coupons.

458
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,542
Coupons can't make me rich.

459
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,127
How is that possible?

460
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,171
WELCOME, FRESHMEN OF 2009!

461
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,676
EUICHEON UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION

462
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,094
Welcome!

463
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,104
I thought about it every day, Yeon-jin.

464
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,732
Where should I reunite with you?

465
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,694
You have it all.

466
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,864
You are scared of no one.

467
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,201
So, where is the place
that will make you scared,

468
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,953
even for a second?

469
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,791
I couldn't think of any other place.

470
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,464
My own gymnasium of 60 square meters.

471
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,091
HA YE-SOL

472
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,178
Wow, that's just like a fairy tale.

473
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,641
Now I'm going to wield
a very soft, very bright curling iron.

474
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:22,480
The one that you cherish the most,
Yeon-jin.

475
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,232
Is my story like a fairy tale?

476
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,528
Yes, but I don't like it
because my mom's not the main character.

477
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,156
What makes you think that?

478
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,492
Because my mom is rich.

479
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,912
And the main characters are all poor.

480
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,249
No, you're wrong.

481
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,003
In this story,
your mother is the main character.

482
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,341
Because this story isn't a fairy tale.

483
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,343
It's a fable.

484
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,473
Fog is considered dense

485
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,601
when it has a visibility range
of less than one kilometer.

486
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,938
A fog warning was issued yesterday,
and it is still in effect today.

487
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,942
Did you know
that the main hindrance to safe flights

488
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,528
is not typhoons or lightning, but fog?

489
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,863
"Anyone who injures their neighbor

490
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,865
is to be injured in the same manner."

491
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,619
Although the number of accidents
is the highest on clear days,

492
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,622
the fatality rate
is the highest on foggy days.

493
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,167
Please be careful of the fog.
This is Park Yeon-jin.

494
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,715
"Eye for eye,

495
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,717
tooth for tooth…

496
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,053
…fracture for fracture."

497
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,598
"The one who inflicted the injury
must suffer the same."

498
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,310
I don't know.

499
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,438
That sounds...

500
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,066
too fair to me.
